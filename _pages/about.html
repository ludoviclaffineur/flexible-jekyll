            In 2013, I graduated from the I.S.I.B. in Brussels with a degree in software engineering, and my first job
            was a two-year R&D project in the area of network sonification using <a href="http://laras.be">Laras</a>.
            The major objective was to
            produce sounds from network packets so that the network infrastructure could be directly heard through
            audio.

            <h2 class="main-page-tagline">
                I began working with <a href="https://odoo.com">Odoo</a> as a client solution developer in September
                2015, where my duties included
                creating and delivering customized solutions for the company's clients. I acquired the skills necessary
                to create what is truly important for the client. The ability to deliver high-quality services quickly
                is what defines a service's excellence, and I firmly believe that business analysis and client
                management are crucial to achieving this.

                I joined <a href="https://skipr.co">Skipr</a> as a software engineer in September 2017 in order to
                create an app that would allow everyone to move anywhere. We created a product from scratch while
                validating every step along the way. In two
                years, we went from 1 to 40 members, and we are now based in Belgium and prepared to expand throughout
                Europe. My responsibility was to aid our development team in achieving its objectives in all areas,
                including processes, code quality, architecture, and personnel management.
