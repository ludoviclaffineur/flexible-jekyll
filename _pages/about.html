        <h2 class="main-page-tagline">I studied software engineering at I.S.I.B. in Brussels in 2013 and my first work
            experience was a 2 year R&D project in the field of network sonification <a href="http://laras.be">Laras</a>. The main
            goal was to create sounds from network packets in order to have a direct audio picture of what's happening
            on the network infrastructure (more to come soon).</h2>

            <h2 class="main-page-h2">Client Solution Engineer</h2>
            <h2 class="main-page-tagline">In September 2015 I started work for <a href="https://odoo.com">Odoo</a> as a client
                solution developer where I was responsible to develop and ship,tailored solutions for the customers. I
                learnt the practices to develop what really matters for the client. The excellence of services lies in
                the capacity to deliver quality fast and I truly believe that business analysis and client management
                are key to achieve that.</h2>

            <h2 class="main-page-tagline">In September 2017 I joined <a href="https://skipr.co">Skipr</a> as developer in order to
                build an app that would enable everyone to move everywhere. We built a product from scratch with all the
                validation of intermediate steps. We went from 1 to 40 people in two years and are live in Belgium and
                ready to spread in Europe. My job was to support our development team to achieve our goals in any matter
                -- processes, code quality, architecture and people management.</h2>
