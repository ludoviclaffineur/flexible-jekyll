When I started my journey as a software engineer in my last company, I had no idea that I would end up in a team leading/engineer manager role. This happens frequently with fast-growing companies, where founding engineers evolve to a leader role quickly without being really prepared (that's where the fun is, right?). It's challenging to be promoted from a building role (where you are in charge to discuss and deliver a scope) to a role where your team needs to commit on a deadline where the scope, feasibility and timing are keys and are most of the time fuzzy and not _totally_ under your control.

This post relates to my experience and what I faced during the past 5 years. This is probably not what other founding engineers might have faced in other companies. I do not

## Founding software engineer

When joining an early stage company, everyone is taking extra responsibilities (even if they are not the best to do it) to run the business and it goes the same way for the software engineer role that requires much more than coding skills. Your main asset at that time is probably <mark>communication</mark> because this is the time when everything _looks_ possible and being able to communicate internally and externally about what you are able to do will definitely help the company to commit about deadlines.

Also, it's a green field with very little tech debt so you can almost do everything (disclaimer: you certainly should not). The most complex part there is to iterate fast and <mark>validate business hypothesis with as less development as possible</mark> because you don't want to invest your time to something that might be discarded the next month because nobody is using it. 

Also, your time will be spread into other topics than pure development. To make it more tangible, this is a list of tasks I did on a regular basis the first year at the company:

### Tech:
- Architecture decision
- Developing
- Testing
- Shipping
- Dev Ops
- Analyse external solutions to accelerate the development

### Product Management:
- Providing feedback from bugs and limitation of the solution
- Defining user stories
- Data analysis
- Project management

### External communication:
- Reassure partners that you are a trustworthy tech department
- Going to events to sell/explain the solution
- Users' feedback management (support, bug)

Concretely, some mornings you will have to isolate yourself to ship that feature at the end of the sprint and the next day, you are going to explain and sell the solution to external parties in order to get access to their API.

<mark>The asset for a company is to have a communicative engineer able to solve problems.</mark> As the company has at best some traction, no product and of course no product market fit (PMF), the usual mindset is to be fast in the delivery with a scope that is quite important. At that time, you are ready to build anything that must be rebuilt when the PMF as been found. Say hello to technical debt, no code and manual work!

This stage has the incredible power that alignment across people is easy as you work all together in the same place. The tech team (very small) is also very confident about what they are able to deliver.

## From building to leading
The company is getting more funds to accelerate the development so, good news, the tech team is growing! As you are the one who participated in most of the development you start to have to onboard new team members on the different codebases, make sure they understand product requirements and you review the code/features because you know the dark places of the code. You naturally receive a title according to this new responsibilities as you are less and less developing new features.

That's the moment you have to decide what is your focus as the CTO plays the cross team alignment role and vision, your role becomes more and more precise and that's the moment you start to tackle the big part of the technical debt. You focus on an area and delegate part of the codebase to other technical lead, so they can move their own pace. You rebuild part of the software but still, the team needs to accelerate shipping.

<mark>Your role start to shift from solving problems to creating stability, process, common understanding and standards.</mark> You are not in a very small team and having team members with different experiences can lead to frustrations and inconsistencies in the way of delivering features as a whole. The team needs to set standard ways of working so that they don't argue on an architecture decision on every pull request and new players/teammates know what are the rules of the game.

At this stage you start to understand that your biggest strength for the team is probably not coding itself as you hired experienced software engineers for the technology you used but the knowledge you have on the business, software and past implementations. You start to ask yourself more and more: <mark>What did we forget to think about this feature at this stage and might fire back in a later stage of development?</mark>

On a regular basis, you find gap in the way a feature is being implementated and you start to communicate proactively to the team and product managers what we might forget and ask them how we should deal with this new information. Side story: the team starts to know that if you arrive in a call, it's probably to bring _bad_ news or that something pops out that we did not think about earlier. It means most of the time, delays for the product team as more work has to be done by the development team or scope reduction.
