It's been awhile that I wanted to start writing about experiences and things I want to share. As a secondary goal I also hope it will also force myself to structure those experiences into words in order to get the best out of them. I will share about my previous work experience, maybe geeky sometimes (you might see some code here), also about working as a team. Before moving forward, let's start by introducing myself.

I am an enthusiastic Belgian who loves to build and create things. I truly believe that being empathic and direct to your peers is a gift and that we should not be too focus to do things only for a bigger purpose -- *Fun has to be part of work*.

I studied engineering at I.S.I.B. in Brussels and my first work experience was as a researcher in the field of sonification of the network at [Laras](http://laras.be). The main goal was to create sound from network packets in order to have a direct audio picture of what's happening on the network infrastructure (more to come soon).

After that I went to [Odoo](https://odoo.com) as a client solution developer where I was responsible to develop and ship customisations for the customers. I learnt the practices to develop what was needed and only focus on what really matters for the client -- The excellence of services lies in our capacity to deliver quality fast and I truly believe that business analysis and client management are key to achieve that.

Two years ago I got the opportunity to start at [Skipr](https://skipr.co) as developer in order to build an app that would enable everyone to move everywhere. That is the first time that I am part of building a product from scratch with all the validation of intermediate steps. We went from 1 to 20 people in two years and are live in Belgium. I grew and hope to still grow a lot in that company and my job become now to support our development team to achieve our goals in any matter -- it can be related to processes (improve the way we work), tech and people management.
